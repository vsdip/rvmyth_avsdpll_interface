**The aim of this repository is to integrate rvmyth (RISC-V CPU core developed by VSD) with a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) as a clock multiplier using open-source EDA tools. The whole project focuses on Mixed Signal Physical Design.** 
### Tools Required

*iverilog and gtkwave*


### Problem Statement

The rvmyth is a digital block whereas the pll is an ananlog block. To achieve the integration firstly we need to generate a verilog block for the PLL and take the output of the PLL and give it as an input to the rvmyth. This will create the interface then the PNR flow must be implemented.

## Installation steps

1. Install iverilog and gtkwave

2. Simulate rvmyth using the following steps: 

   -  git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/rvmyth/ <br />
   -  cd rvmyth <br />
   -  iverilog mythcore_test.v tb_mythcore_test.v <br />
   -  ./a.out <br />
   -  gtkwave tb_mythcore_test.vcd <br />


<img src = "https://github.com/vsdip/rvmyth_avsdpll_interface/blob/main/pics/3a.PNG" width = 700>

Design a PLL as a clock multiplier using verilog and test the functionality.

  - iverilog avsd_pll_1v8.v pll_tb.v
  - ./a.out
  - gtkwave test.vcd

Now integrate both rvmyth and avsdpll using a top level testbench and test it to verify.

 - iverilog rvmyth_pll.v rvmyth_pll_tb.v
 - ./a.out
 - gtkwave test1.vcd

## OpenLANE and sky130 Installation steps

OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault,SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization (https://github.com/efabless/openlane). <br />

The OpenLANE and sky130 installation can be done by referring this repository https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script.

Once installation is done the next step is synthesis. <br />


### Synthesis in yosys
In OpenLANE the RTL synthesis, technology mapping and timing reports are performed by different tools. <br />
- RTL synthesis by yosys.
- Technology mapping by abc.
- Timing reports are generated by OpenSTA. <br />

Verilog file(.v) of the avsdpll and its LIB(.lib) file.
To generate the LIB file run the perl script given on this link, with the command given below.
perl verilog_to_lib.pl avsddac.v avsddac

To perform synthesys in yosys --> Just type yosys in linux shell. --> Then follow the script

read_verilog rvmyth_pll.v <br />
read_liberty -lib avsd_pll_1v8.lib <br />
read_liberty -lib sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib <br />
synth -top rvmyth_pll_interface <br />
dfflibmap -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib <br />
opt <br />
abc -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib -script +strash;scorr;ifraig;retime;{D};strash;dch,-f;map,-M,1,{D} <br />
flatten <br />
setundef -zero <br />
clean -purge <br />
rename -enumerate <br />
stat <br />
write_verilog -noattr rvmyth_avsddac.synth.v <br />


The synthesized netlist is *avsd_pll_1v8.synth.v* <br />

The snapshot of the synthesized netlist.

--> Now, simulate the generated netlist in iverilog & gtkwave to compare the pre - synthesis and post- synthesis simulations.

For that you'd need to create a verilog code for gate level simulation that must include the synthesized netlist verilog file obtained from yosys. The files necessary for pre and post synthesis can be found here.

Both pre-synth and post-synth simulations must give out the same output.
